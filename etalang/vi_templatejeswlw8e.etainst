There are multiple lights connected to\n#single photon detectors (labeled as 1,2,3,etc.), and one light connected\n#to the laser (labeled as 0). Light flashes when a signal comes. \n#\n#In addition, there are many time recorders, each with a button and a \n#screen. When you press the button, it will display the current time on\n#its screen. When you press again, it overwrites the display.\n#\n#You start with a initial time recorder. When there is a flash, you move\n#to a time recorder according to the instruction and press the button.\n#Then you wait for another flash.  \n#\n#Each circle indicates a time recorder, and label indicates its name.\n#Use pointer to indicate the transition form one recorder to another, \n#put the label of the light you should wait for on the label of each\n#transition.\n#To draw the instruction, you can use both mouse and keys.\n#\n#Mouse:\n#    Double click on empty space - creates new time recorder\n#    Click on a circle and drag to another - creates new transition\n#    Double click on a circle or transition - edit its label\n#    Right Click to move circle and transitions\n#\n#Keys:\n#    Ctrl + click - multiselection\n#    Ctrl + Z - undo a command\n#    Ctrl + Y - redo a command\n#    Delete - deletes selected elements\n#    Ctrl + T/R - mark/reset a element\n#    Ctrl + I - make selected circle as the initial one (exclusively)\n"}
